Program 7.1: 
Develop C++ programs to demonstrate different forms of inheritance
Program:. 
#include<iostream> using namespace std; class vehicle{ 
public: 
vehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is a vehicle"<<endl;} 
}; 
class car:public vehicle 
{ 
public: 
car(){ 
cout<<"This vehicle is a car"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI291"<<endl; 
car obj; return 0; 
} 


Multiple Inheritance:
Program: 
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class landvehicle{ 
public: 
landvehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is a land vehicle"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class watervehicle{ public: 
watervehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is a water vehicle"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class amphibiousvehicle:public watervehicle,public landvehicle{ public: 
amphibiousvehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is an both land and water vehicle"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
int main(){ 
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI291"<<endl; 
amphibiousvehicle obj; return 0; 
} 


Multilevel Inheritance: 
Program: 

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class vehicle{ public: 
vehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is a vehicle"<<endl;} 
}; 
class fourwheeler:public vehicle{ public: 
fourwheeler(){ 
cout<<"4 wheeler vehicles"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class car:public fourwheeler{ public: 
car(){ 
cout<<"This 4 wheeler vehicle is a car"; 
} 
}; 
int main(){ 
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI291"<<endl; 
car obj; return 0; 
} 


Hierarchical Inheritance:
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; class vehicle{ 
public: 
vehicle(){ 
cout<<"This is a vehicle"<< endl; 
} 
}; 
class car : public vehicle{ public: 
car(){ 
cout<<"This vehicle is a car"<< endl; 
} 
}; 
class bus : public vehicle{ public: 
bus(){ 
cout<<"This vehicle is bus"<< endl; 
} 
}; 
int main(){ 
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI291"<<endl; 
car obj1; bus obj2; 
} 

 
Hybrid Inheritance: 
Program:

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
class vehicle{ public: 
vehicle(){ 
cout<<"this is a vehicle"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class fare{ public: fare(){ 
cout<<"fare of a vehicle"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class car:public vehicle{ public: 
car(){ 
cout<<"this vehicle is a car"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
class bus:public vehicle,public fare{ public: 
bus(){ 
cout<<"this vehicle is a bus with fare"<<endl; 
} 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
cout<<"Roll No:24B11AI291"<<endl; 
bus obj2; 
}
